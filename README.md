swift-2048
==========

A working port of [iOS-2048](https://github.com/austinzheng/iOS-2048) to Apple's new Swift language.

Like the original Objective-C version, swift-2048 does not rely upon SpriteKit. See the description for iOS-2048 for more information.

I'm not actively working on this, except to fix bugs and maintain compatibility with latest versions. Pull requests are welcome, though. Note that Swift was very different back when I first wrote this code, caveat emptor.


If you want to check out a more advanced Swift project, please take a look at **[Cormorant](https://github.com/austinzheng/Cormorant)**, my Clojure interpreter.

Instructions
------------

You will need Xcode 7 to run the project. Run it in the simulator or on an actual device.

Tap the button to play the game. Swipe to move the tiles.

Thoughts on Swift
-----------------

Swift is a well-designed language that will, hopefully, drag mainstream programming halfway to ML (kicking and screaming the entire way, of course).

If you really want to see my out-of-date thoughts on Swift, check out the git history for `README.md`.
